can you generate a prototype for the project?

Quest Log - Prototype v1
I'll create a working prototype that demonstrates the core concepts of your Quest Log project!

Quest Log Prototype v1
Code 
I've created a working prototype! Here's what it includes:

Prototype Features
‚úÖ Implemented:
Quest Management
Create quests with different difficulties (Trivial ‚Üí Epic)
Quest types (Main, Side, Daily)
Skill associations (Productivity, Learning, Health, Creativity)
Complete quests to earn XP
RPG Mechanics
XP and leveling system with exponential curve
Character progression tracking
Skill development system
Achievement unlocking
Knowledge Base (PKMS)
Add and view notes
Tagging system
Timestamped entries
JSON Persistence
Saves to data/player.json
Saves to data/quests.json
Saves to data/knowledge.json
Terminal Interface
Main menu system
Interactive quest creation
Character sheet display
Simple chat advisor (placeholder for AI)
How to Use the Prototype
bash
# Save the code to a file
nano quest_log_prototype.py

# Make it executable
chmod +x quest_log_prototype.py

# Run it
python3 quest_log_prototype.py
What's Missing (For Full Version)
ü§ñ AI Integration - Chat is currently rule-based
üé® Rich library for prettier terminal UI
üß™ Tests - No unit tests yet
üìä Data visualization - Could add ASCII graphs
üîç Search functionality - Can't search knowledge base yet
‚è∞ Quest scheduling - No time-based features
üîÑ Recurring quests - Daily quests don't auto-regenerate
Save This to Your Repo
bash
# Create prototypes folder
mkdir -p prototypes

# Save the prototype
# (paste the code into this file)
nano prototypes/quest_log_v1.py

# Commit it
git add prototypes/quest_log_v1.py
git commit -m "Add Quest Log prototype v1 - basic functionality"
git push
Next Steps
Test the prototype - Run it and create some quests!
Document it - Add a README explaining what works
Get feedback - Show it to your professor/classmates
Plan v2 - Decide which features to add next
Want me to create a more advanced prototype with the Rich library for prettier UI, or help you add AI integration?
