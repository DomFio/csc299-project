its looking good! Lets start to implement this now.

create a prototype command-line application that allows storing, listing, and searching tasks stored in a JSON data file
put the code into files underneath a directory tasks1 in your csc299-project repository
add a README.md file with instructions for running your code inside the tasks1 directory
so your csc299-project repository should have a tasks1 directory, and Python file(s) plus a README.md file inside that tasks1 directory
make sure that your commits are in your public GitHub repo (not just your local repository)
Perfect! Let's implement this step by step. I'll create the necessary files for you to set up in your repository.

Step 1: Create the Main Application File
quest_log.py - Main Application
Code 
Step 2: Create the README.md File
README.md for tasks1
Document 
Step 3: Terminal Commands to Set Everything Up
Now, here's exactly what you need to do in your terminal:

Perfect! Now let me create one more helpful artifact - a quick reference guide:

Quick Setup Guide
Document 
Perfect! Now you have everything you need. Here's your action plan:

ðŸ“‹ Your Implementation Checklist
Files to Download/Copy:
quest_log.py - The main application (from first artifact)
README.md - The instructions for tasks1 (from second artifact)
Setup commands - Reference for terminal commands (from third artifact)
Quick guide - Fast reference (from fourth artifact)
Steps to Complete:
Today (30-45 minutes):

âœ… Create the csc299-project repository locally
âœ… Create tasks1/ directory
âœ… Copy quest_log.py into tasks1/
âœ… Copy README.md into tasks1/
âœ… Test the application runs correctly
âœ… Create the repository on GitHub (make it PUBLIC)
âœ… Push everything to GitHub
âœ… Verify it's all visible on GitHub
Before Next Class: 9. âœ… Save our conversation to conversations/01-pre-assignment.md 10. âœ… Commit and push the conversation 11. âœ… Test that someone else could clone and run your code

Quick Command Summary:
bash
# Setup
mkdir csc299-project && cd csc299-project
git init
mkdir -p tasks1 conversations

# Add files (create and paste content)
nano tasks1/quest_log.py
nano tasks1/README.md
nano conversations/01-pre-assignment.md

# Test
cd tasks1 && python3 quest_log.py && cd ..

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Quest Log prototype"

# Push to GitHub (after creating repo online)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/csc299-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Any questions before you start? Or are you ready to begin setting it up?
